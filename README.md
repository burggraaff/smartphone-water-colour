Code used to analyse RAW RGB images of water and calculate the remote sensing reflectance and water colour, as described in the [our paper in Frontiers in Remote Sensing](https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frsen.2022.940096).

This repository contains all code used in the paper it accompanies, except for the WISPweb processing of raw WISP-3 data into radiances, and the 3C processing of So-Rad data into remote sensing reflectance.
