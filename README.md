Code used to analyse RAW RGB images of water according to the HydroColor and WACODI methods.

This is very much a work-in-progress project. Detailed documentation will follow once development is complete.

This repository contains all data used in the paper it accompanies, except for the WISPweb processing of raw WISP-3 data into radiances, and the 3C processing of So-Rad data into remote sensing reflectance.

_This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 776480 (MONOCLE)._
